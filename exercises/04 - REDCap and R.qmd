## Downloading data with REDCapR

The following code chunk will use the **REDCapR** package to connect to a REDCap database and download its data into an object called `my_redcap_data`. Run the code chunk.

```{r}
library(REDCapR)

creds <- retrieve_credential_local("../data-private/credentials.csv", 1)

uri <- creds$redcap_uri
token <- creds$token

my_redcap_data <- redcap_read_oneshot(uri, token)$data
```

When this runs successfully, it will give you a message that [looks like an error]{style="color:red"} but is really just a status message. The HTTP status code "200" means "success."

So if this ran without an error, pat yourself on the back! You just used R to access the REDCap API via REDCapR and downloaded a project into the data frame named `my_redcap_data`. Pretty cool!
